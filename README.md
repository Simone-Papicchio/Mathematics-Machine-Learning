# Mathematics-Machine-Learning
The scope of the project is to explain the math behind the Machine Learning Algorithms.
More precisely, the following algorithm/concept have been mathematically explained:
1. **Local Outlier Factor**
2. **Robust Scaler**
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
4. **Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)**
5. **Empirical Risk Minimization**
6. **No-Free-Lunch Theorem**
7. **Bias Complexity Trade-off**
8. **Stratified cross validation**
9. **Random Forest**
10. **Hard/Soft/kernelized SVM**
11. **Logistic Regression**
